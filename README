# PvZ Clone

This repository contains a small HTML/JS/CSS implementation inspired by Plants vs. Zombies.

## Quick start
Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Use the buttons to choose a plant type and click a grid cell to place it. Sunflowers generate sun over time while peashooters attack zombies. Earn sun to place more plants and keep the zombies from reaching the left side. Click **Restart** to start over.
