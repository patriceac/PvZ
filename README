# PvZ Clone

This repository contains a very small HTML/JS/CSS implementation inspired by Plants vs. Zombies.

## Quick Start

Open `index.html` in a web browser. Choose a plant type and click on the lawn to
place it. Sunflowers generate sun which can be spent on more plants while
peashooters attack zombies. Use the restart button to play again.
