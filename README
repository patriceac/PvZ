# PvZ Clone

This repository contains a small HTML/JS/CSS implementation inspired by Plants vs. Zombies.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Click inside the grid to place plants and stop the zombies.

The game now features a score counter, increasing difficulty and a restart button when you lose.
