# PvZ Clone

This repository contains a small HTML/JS/CSS implementation inspired by Plants vs. Zombies.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Click inside the grid to place plants and stop the zombies.

The game now features a score counter, level progression and a restart button when you lose. Zombies spawn more slowly at first and speed up as the game progresses. Each level ends after a fixed number of zombies are defeated and the next level begins automatically.

Peashooters will only fire when a zombie is in the same row, saving resources when lanes are empty.
